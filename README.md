## Project 1 Search:
  * In this project, Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.
  * Implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search.
  *  Created different heuristics. Helped pacman agent find shortest path       to eat all dots.
