# CS188-AI-Projects
My solutions to the projects of the course of "Artificial Intelligence" (CS188) at the UC Berkeley.

## Project 1 Search:
In this project,Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.
Implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. Created different heuristics. Helped pacman agent find shortest path to eat all dots.

Example for A* maze search:
